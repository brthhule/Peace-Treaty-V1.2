case 2:
- You can select to move one of your army units. Only army units deployed with an army commander can move (these are sent out via your capital). \n

- If you move an army unit to an empty province, the army unit takes over that province without resistance. \n
- If you move an army unit to an enemy province, the army unit will attack the enemy province. The army with the greater combat power will win, but the amount of losses and the types of troops lost will vary depending on troop composition. \n
- If you move an army unit to one of your provinces, you can absorb some of the garrison troops into the army as long as the army capacity is not exceeded. You can also merge troops from two or more different armies so long as they're in the same province, but there cannot be two army commanders in one army. \n\n
You can increase the size of an army by increasing the level of the army's commander (this can only be done when the army commander and their army are in the capital-- player action \"player deployment\"). \n
