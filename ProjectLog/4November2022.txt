	3:40 pm - 4:00 pm (20 min): Did some cleaning up, made some do while functions into recursion statements, trying to make code more readible
as I jump back into things. Getting LNK1168 error

    10:05 - 10:10 pm (5 min): I think trying to include recursion is what threw the program off; I reverted to the August 27 save.

    10:25 - 10:35 (10 min): Added kingdonName to viewPlayerStats. Found it somewhat hard to find the viewPlayerStats function to add this change; may have to consider developing a way to find functions easier. Eliminated an unneccessary parameter: introduction function in main.cpp used startOrResume as a paramater when it wouldn't be used to find out listOfActions(3), so took it out. Note: code looks extremely cluncky and difficult to navigate, have to find a way to clean up code I don't need

    10:35 - 11:00 (25 min): Looked around for things to clean up, came across viewArmyOverview. After selecting a commander, the stats would go to the addresses of what the stats were (because the stats function used an array that held pointers to the variables with the states, forgot to add the *). Troops injured is correct (start off all 0), but the other stats are off (ex, food starts off as -2213361676, this shouldn't happen). Have to keep looking through and cleaning code
