June 10th - June 15th: 7 hours
  developed introduction
  developed framework for player attack, build, and train 
	developed functionality for player attack, so player army size plays a factor
  developed translation system to turn inputed coordinates into multidimensional array indices
  developed functionality for showing map of game
  developed functionality for selecting unit for building/training
  developed troop army framework
-----------------------------------
June 16th: 45 min (all of sixth period, into seventh and including 1st and 2nd period a little bit) developed resource management when building infrastructure, fixed all stats function to reflect total player resources update land resources functionality-- each turn, increase amount of resources in each province by production rate of buildings
-----------------------------
June 19th: 2 hours
	9:45 pm - 10:45 pm (1 hour): downloading microsoft visual studio to do offline work, developed troop train function to train troops, subtract
the necessary mamterials, ad add to the total amount of troops

	10:45 pm - 11:45 pm (1 hour): testing game. Need to do the following: fix functionality for kingdom name to include spacing, fix gameplay values
(such as resource amounts) to make sense, fix it so that when entering coordinates and other integer/numerical entries, the game doesn't just break, need to start adding AI gameplay------------- exception handling minigame idea: just buildings and training troops-- train as many troop as possible until you can't proceed to the next turn
------------------------------
June 20: (1 hour, 40 min)
	10:00 pm - 10:20 pm (20 min): Figured out what was wrong with input for kingdom name, used cin.ignore() and fixed it

	10:20 pm - 11:00 pm (40 min): Functionality so that entering mutiple values for first prompt (S/R) wouldn't end up in error (checkChar function)
	11:00 pm - 11:40 pm (40 min): Fixed check char function, made it so function actually works
-----------------------------------
June 21: 20 min
	Tried figuring out how to use multiple cpp files, didn't work
-----------------------------------------
June 22: 30 min
	5:45 pm - 6:00 pm (15 min): Figured out how to use multiple files, had to create new project from project -> add module, have to find "solution explorer"(go to view)

	15 more minutes: tried to create a second file for TrainMAHeader (playerBuildHeader), crashed the system. playerBuildHeader doesn't work. Looking for a solution
---------------------------------------
June 23: 30 min
	10:15 pm - 10:45v (30 min): Tried ironing out how to fix the program. Problems with the first projet (FFE V1.1), made new project (FFE V1.2)
---------------------------------
June 24: 1 hour, 30 min
	6:15 am - 7:45 am (1 hour, 30 min): Figured out how to use multiple files. Cannot use functions that use other functions (funciton in .cpp file cannot use functions from main), found a work around (use functions that don't use other functions, or modify the function
so that it uses passed arguments rather than functions).
------------------------------------
June 25: 2 hours, 35 min
	3:45 pm - 4:00 pm (15 min): Uploaded visual stuido on my personal computer at home, tried using a flashdrive to upload the project and transfer it from laptop to computer. Didn't work, flashdrive failed, is broken now. Copied and pasted code onto repl.it, then did so again to transfer from repl to vistual studio on pc. Up and running now

	4:00 pm - 4:20 pm (20 min): Fixed checkChar functions so that they didn't use the same variable names. Used keyword/phrase "AV" after string name for each instance to differentiate between checkChar cases

	4:20 pm - 4:35 pm (15 min): Started deleting extra material (used to use do and while loops to check characters, deleted these structures due to nature of checkChar)

	4:35 pm - 4:35 pm (1 hour): replaced selectUnit function with switch statement rather than if statements, added checkInt to area where user is prompted to enter coordinates for 
upgrade building funciton, did more deleting of extra content

	8:45 pm - 9:30 pm (45 min): Moved translateCoordinate function from main to otherFunctions file, some clearing up
---------------------------------
June 26: 1 hour, 45 min
	8:45 pm - 9:30 pm (45 min): Developed framework to use enemy AI, player can now choose continent size and opponent number, created and am now working on army deployment function

	9:30 pm - 10:15 pm (45 min): Developing army commander training

	10:15 pm - 10:30 pm (15 min): Replaced checkChar AV arrays with vectors (so I didn't have to worry about arrays being the ame size))
-----------------------------------
June 27: 2 hours, 15 min
	1:05 pm - 2:00 pm (55 min): Updated checkInt to use vectors (1:22), cleaned up function initializations and stuff

	3:30 pm - 4:00 (30 min): Checking stuff around, looking at how to utilize mapArmyNumbers, split this into four arrays

	10:00 pm - 10:50 (50 min): Worked on battle calculations (made battleCalculationsTwo to reduce redundancy and clean up code)
-----------------------------------------
June 29: 1 hour
	11:30 am - 12:30 pm (1 hour): something happened, have to use std::cout (I think maybe too much code?), working on scout log fucntion, thinking about adding repeats so functions don't automatically default to rerouting to the main menu after an action-- stays at a particular action until player says to go to the previous menu.
-----------------------------
June 30: 3 hours, 50 min
	1:30 pm - 1:45 (15 min): Updated variable names (changed armyCommander variables to be more specific), changed trainCommanders function from char to void,
laid framework so that specific functions reroute to the "local" menu rather than the main menu, such as the trainCommanders function going to the "Army Deployment action menu" rather than the main menu.

	2:35 pm - 5:30 (2 hours, 55 min): Made all action functions void so it loops back, cleaning up of stuff, developed upgradeCommander function and working 
on armyDeployment function

	9:05 pm - 9:45 (40 min): Worked on moveUnit function, starting adding building blocks together
