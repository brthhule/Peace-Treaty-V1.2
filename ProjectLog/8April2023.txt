April 3 (Netherlands): 30 min
	11:40 (April 3) - 12:10 am (30 min): Updated display stuff, screen now clears after most inputs to cut down on clunkiness. Working ont he U main action. Working on getting the Coordiantes situation sorted out. I'll come back to this another time.
	12:25 - 12:30: Fixed the coordinates issue. Problem was that the raw coordinates (xCoord and yCoord) are right coordinates for display-- using printCoordinates translated the coordinates unneccessarily. Nevermind, still not working...
--------------------------
April 11: 15 min
	15 min: Fixed some output stuff, tried working on fixing printCoordinates to display the coordinates in a way that matches up with the graph display. I might do something like have each object have input/out coordinates so instead of translating coordinate, it just finds the province with the coordinates or something like that
-----------------------
April 12: 20 min
	20 min: Looked into fixing the coordinates problem. It looks like the actual coordinates of the province at hand belongs to an enemy capital. The ouput coordinates are wrong too. Trying to figure out where along the process it's wrong. Made printOutputCoordinates return a string instead of being void, working on changing instances of that to string throughout the program.
---------------------------
April 14: 30 min
	30 min: took ArmyDeployment stuff out of participants, worked on participants pickProvince and stuff-- took out some if statemetns (safeties are built into getInput)
------------------------------------------
April 23: 1 hour
	9:00 - 10:00 pm (1 hour): Worked on a flowchart to help visualize the program.
