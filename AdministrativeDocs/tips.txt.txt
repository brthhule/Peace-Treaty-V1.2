/*How to use colors: */
/*On Linux, you can change the current foreground and background color by writing special character sequences into the output. Write the ESC escape character (octal "\033", hex \x1b), followed by an opening square bracket [. The color definition will follow next, termniated by a lowercase m.

The color definition is a series of numbers, separated by semicolons. In order to make the text color red (number 31),
you can write "\033[31m" which will make any following output red. If you want yellow text (33) on blue background (44),
you write "\033[31;44m". To reset everything back to the default colors, you write "\033[0m".

         foreground background
black        30         40
red          31         41
green        32         42
yellow       33         43
blue         34         44
magenta      35         45
cyan         36         46
white        37         47
Additionally, you can use these:

reset             0  (everything back to normal)
bold/bright       1  (often a brighter shade of the same colour)
underline         4
inverse           7  (swap foreground and background colours)
bold/bright off  21
underline off    24
inverse off      27*/
