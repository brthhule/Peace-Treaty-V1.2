# Peace-Treaty-V1.2
Current status: In development (will not run)

Concept:
4x turn-based strategy game combining aspects of games like Civilizations, Hexonia, Polytopia, Lords Mobile, Rise of Kingdoms, and Infinity Kingdom with original ideas. Aim: A game with the semantics of a massively multiplayer strategy game like Lords Mobile but applied to the structure/procedures of a turn-based game like Civilizations? 

Game experience:
- Users can choose from a variety of options such as building infrastructure, developing armies, training troops, and attacking others
- Users expand across the map and may attak or develop diplomatic relations with other users/bots
- Win conditions:
1) Defeat all other kingdoms (a kingdom dies when it has no provinces and no commanders)
2) Make peace with all other kingdoms (establish diplomatic superiority)
3) Defeat some kingdoms and make peace with all others (mixed approach)
- Attack functionaltiy: Train commanders (in charge of armies) and troops (basic army units) and use them to attack/defend provinces
- Diplomacy functionality: Defend other players' provinces with your troops, develop alliances, send resources, and send workers to help develop infrastruture in other kingdoms
        - The more involved with other kingdoms, the more diplomatic influence you have over them. If 50% + 1 of something came from you, you have diplomatic superiority over that kingdom
        - Example 1 - If a kingdom has 10 commanders and 1 or 5 were sent by you, you have diplomatic influence over them
        - c) Example 2 - If a kingdom has 10 commanders and 6 or more were sent by you, you have diplomatic influence

Background/Skill Level:
My current C++ skill level is beginner. This project is based on a game I started my freshman year of high school in Computer Programming 1. I intend to continue working and developing the game as a life-long project to help me work on my skills. This game is not meant for release, but rather my own personal enjoyment. However, it is open source so others may use my work as a base for their own projects or to incorporate some of my ideas.
