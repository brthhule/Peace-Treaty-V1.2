Need to do:
- set up enemy gameplay-- use random number system to build, train, attack, or scout
- scout functionality-- fog of war, can only explore areas of the map that are on the continent, 
- can only scout territories bordering player's kingdom
- have opponent number variable, figure this out. Is only in generateContinent function and the one above it, doesn't show up anywhere else. Should be in resume game code
(global variable?)
- add fog of war (have another map array, this is shown when the player views the map)
- add population cap to provinces-- add residence building, increasing level increases the amount held by garrison (not affected by commander army size, 
or maybe it is?)
- add immigrant functionality-- the more peaceful a nation, more immigrants come per turn, immigrants needed to train troops
- add feed population functionality-- every turn, each province/army consumes food?
- residential building-- cap on immigrants and troops per province
- add functionality to modify troop stats: militia has 12 carrying capacity, guards have CP increased to 12 when defending, cavalry have CP 
increased to 12 when attacking, knights have CP increased to 12 when fighting against an army with paladins (to counter paladins), paladins just have stats of 16
by value-- do the same for Provinces
-Rewrite battle calculations so both the attacking commander and the defending commander(s) lose CP throughout battle, changes 
how battle functionality works... Consider if all enemy defending units are grouped together or not
Key words to look out for (ctrl f)
- "fix this" things that need to be addressed
- "delete this" delete these lines of code if code works without it
- Have to finish working on ScoutMA
- Fix AttackMA
- Add functionality for training province garrisons
- Fix battleCalculations functionality
- Implement Class for army units (militia, guards, knights, paladins, etc...)
- Implement text-based window function for better readilbity
